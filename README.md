Beacon Locator
=======================

An Android application to interact with beacons.  
Implemented in nice material design using Mvvv pattern + data binding and could be used as a reference application for
Altbeacon android library 
[github altbeacon library](http://altbeacon.github.io/android-beacon-library/).

## What does this application can do?

The application can scan and locate beacons (Eddystone, iBeacons or AltBeacons) and present and stire detailed information 
about beacons properties.
The application allows you to define actions that will be triggered when a specified event occurs. 
Currently a beacon may open an application, a website url, send a simple intent action, execute tasker action and 
send device notification on one of the 3 events: the beacon region has been entered or left, a beacon is near you.

More features are coming soon in next release.
